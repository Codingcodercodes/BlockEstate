BlockEstate

A Decentralized Real Estate Registry System powered by Algorand

BlockEstate is a blockchain-based solution designed to bring transparency, trust, and tamper-proof verification to the real estate ecosystem in India. Built on the Algorand blockchain using AlgoKit, this platform enables government officials and landowners to register, verify, and transfer property ownership seamlessly and securely.

It is a decentralized property marketplace that enables secure house buying and selling using the Algorand blockchain. It leverages AlgoKit and PyTeal for smart contracts, ensuring transparent ownership transfer and tamper-proof transactions. The platform uses Node.js and TypeScript for a real-time web interface, with AlgoPy handling backend logic for a seamless user experience.

AlgoKit CLI
Follow official guide:
AlgoKit Installation

Bootstrap & Build Project
# Bootstrap the project environment
algokit project bootstrap all

# Generate local environment file for smart contracts
cd reallestate-contracts
algokit generate env-file -a target_network localnet

# Build the entire project (contracts + frontend clients)
cd ..
algokit project run build

Running Locally
Frontend
cd projects/reallestate-frontend

# Create local .env file from template
cp .env.template .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev


Open the provided localhost URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173
) in your browser.

Backend
cd ../../backend

# Install required Node.js modules
npm install express dotenv multer jsonwebtoken body-parser mongodb algosdk axios express-session cors

# Start the backend server
node server.js

üîó Smart Contract Integration

Smart contracts reside in the reallestate-contracts directory.

Frontend smart contract clients are generated automatically into projects/reallestate-frontend/src/contracts.

After compiling contracts, run:

npm run generate:app-clients


Use the generated clients in your React components for interacting with the blockchain.
